Skore MSP by Lewis Kennedy

// is a max patch that uses 4 multislider objects to draw/score the playback of 4 seperate groove objects.
Each groove (voice) has a set speed but overall speed within the set range can be set by the second number box (near the toggle)

waveform and coloured meters is for visual feedback

greysliders is the volume of each voice

numberboxes above the greysliders are metro speed, groove speed, sets all steps (after the umenu)

numberboxes above the coloured sliders sets the steps within the multisliders (or set all with numberbox after umenu)

the umenu is the sequnce playback forw = forward, back = backward, pinpon = back and forward

click replace to load a buffer //



for fun faster metro speeds make the patch act like a drawable position granular synth 



have fun and all the best
